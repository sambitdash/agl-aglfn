This package is created to register the [Adobe AGL & AGLFN open source project](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn) (also known as `agl-aglfn`) into the Julia package repository. Anyone using Adobe fonts for Julia applications can refer to this project to access the Adobe glyph names. Please note that this Julia package is not endorsed by Adobe. Hence, the README has been modified.
